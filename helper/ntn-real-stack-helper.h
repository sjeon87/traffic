// NtnRealStackHelper — the Phase-0 keystone of 2026-06 protocol-fidelity audit.
//
// Unlike NtnRealisticTrafficHelper (a plain PointToPoint star whose packets
// never touch any radio physics), this helper installs a REAL NR-style air
// interface — the in-tree `mmwave` module: SpectrumPhy + MAC scheduler + HARQ +
// AMC + RLC/PDCP + RRC + EPC — between caller-supplied satellite (gNB) and
// ground (UE) nodes that already carry their own ns-3 MobilityModel (SGP4,
// HAPS, OpenSky, ...). The link is NTN-ized: free-space (Friis) path loss valid
// at LEO range, a mmWave-NR PHY at an S-band carrier (FR2 numerology, 60 kHz
// SCS — NOT a 3GPP NR-NTN FR1 band/numerology: 2.0 GHz has no assigned 3GPP
// band number, it sits in the n256 uplink, and the 50 MHz default BW exceeds
// the 20/30 MHz NTN-FR1 max). The "satellite EIRP" is a conducted Tx-power
// scalar on a terrestrial 8x8 UniformPlanarArray gNB with SVD beamforming
// (array gain added separately, not a reflector beam / 3 dB footprint).
// HARQ off by default (terrestrial HARQ timers break over the slant), and the
// 3GPP terrestrial spatial-fading channel disabled (invalid at LEO geometry).
//
// Crucially, every headline KPI is MEASURED, not computed:
//   * DL SINR / TBLER / corrupt-fraction come from the mmwave SpectrumPhy
//     RxPacketTraceUe trace (struct ns3::mmwave::RxPacketTraceParams).
//   * Throughput / one-way delay / jitter / loss come from NtnOranSink: every
//     NtnOranApplication packet carries an in-band NtnOranPayloadHeader
//     (seq + TX timestamp + 5QI/S-NSSAI as real bytes inside the GTP tunnel),
//     so the app-layer KPIs are computed from received bytes (WS1 suite).
// WriteHealthReport() emits an HONEST sim_health.csv whose gates assert that the
// packets actually traversed the radio stack and that the KPIs have trace
// provenance — replacing the cosmetic "clock advanced over a P2P link" gates.
//
// Typical use (in any example):
//   NtnRealStackHelper rs;
//   rs.SetSimTime(Seconds(simTime));
//   rs.SetOutputDir(outputDir);
//   rs.Build(satNodes /*gNB, with MobilityModel*/, ueNodes /*ground, with MobilityModel*/);
//   rs.InstallTraffic(NtnRealStackHelper::TrafficProfile::EmbbStreaming,
//                     Seconds(1.0), Seconds(simTime - 1.0));
//   Simulator::Stop(Seconds(simTime));
//   Simulator::Run();
//   rs.Collect();              // pull measured KPIs from FlowMonitor + PHY sink
//   rs.WriteHealthReport();    // honest sim_health.csv
//   Simulator::Destroy();
//
// Module logic (CHO/RIC/slice) reads measured per-UE/per-cell SINR via
// GetMeanDlSinrDb()/GetCellMeanSinrDb() instead of a closed-form formula.

     * a reader takes "plausible-EIRP gate" to mean.
     *
     * This asks the separate question: does the effective EIRP sit within a
     * stated tolerance of the Set-1 reference (34 dBW/MHz over the configured
     * bandwidth, TR 38.821 Table 6.1.1.1-1)?
